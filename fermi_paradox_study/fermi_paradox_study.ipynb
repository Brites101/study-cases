By the results of 2013's Kepler Space Mission, there could be as much as  4x10‚Å∏ Earth-sized planets orbiting in the habitable zones of sun-like stars within the Milky Way Galaxy, out of which [11*10‚Å∑ may be directly orbiting such sun-like stars](https://www.latimes.com/science/la-sci-earth-like-planets-20131105-story.html). This all results into a number of planets simply *too unconceively big for me to attempt a description*.\n",

Because of the expansion of the universe, anything outside our direct galatic neighborhood (aka Local Group) is getting farther aways from us very fast. even if we had extremely fast space tansportation it would take, literally, billions of years to reach any other nearby galaxy. More than enough time for this ships's population to evolve into their own separe species, with a new model of civilization, a religion that worships the ancient gods that built the ship, all while completely forgetting their original mission.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is why we will focus our analysis only on the Local Group. More specifically, the Milky Way. Our home galaxy has over 4x10‚Å∂ stars besides our own, which more than half could be classified as \"sun-like\", while at least 20% have a earth-like planet orbiting them. That is more than enough places for life to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Match in time**\n",

The Milky Way is [over 13x10‚Å∂ years old](https://www.space.com/263-milky-age-narrowed.html). Since earth is just 4x10‚Å∂ years old, and humankind has just started emitting detectable radiation outwards Earth. It is pretty easy to imagine that many civilizations at least as advanced as ours have existed, we just haven't found each other in time.\n",

Fortunately, our galaxy has a spiral shape as many other galaxies. According to the [Encyclopaedia Britannnica](https://www.britannica.com/place/Milky-Way-Galaxy/The-structure-and-dynamics-of-the-Milky-Way-Galaxy) This structure can be viewed as consisting of six separate parts: (1) a nucleus, (2) a central bulge, (3) a disk, (4) spiral arms, (5) a spherical component, and (6) a massive halo.\n",
